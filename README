Throbbie, the over engineered "throwie"
---------------------------------------

Throbbie is a pulsating throwie, designed to be more visually
interesting than a typical throwie.

This repository contains code for an ATtiny13a, which is an 8-bit,
8-pin microcontroller.  The ATtiny13a is used for generating the PWM
signals to a tri-color LED.

The current development environment is AVRStudio4, an AVR JTAGICE
mkII, and an STK500 development board.
