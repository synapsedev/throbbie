Throbbie, the over engineered "throwie"
---------------------------------------

Throbbie is a pulsating throwie, designed to be more visually
interesting than a typical throwie.

The code in this repository contains the code for the ATtiny13a 8-bit,
8-pin microcontroller, which is used for generating the PWM signals to
a tri-color LED.

The current development environment is AVRStudio4, an AVR JTAG ICE
mkII, and an STK500 development board.
